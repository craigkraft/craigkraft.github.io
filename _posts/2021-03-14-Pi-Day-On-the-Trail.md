# Pi Day on The Trail

Review of the minimalist shoe from KickStarter in desert environment.

## Mica Mountain vs. Skinners

Mica picnic view area is a nice ramada to start your adventure. Tucked away in the desert you're getting into lots of dry sand, thorny cactus needles, rocks and pebbles of all kinds.

I was wearing DarnTough 1/4 hiker socks with these shoes and it was a little cramped. There is a small insert that comes with the Skinners and this was also present. I should have guessed that the fit was going to be tight though -  I had to get the largest size they offered, and that was a size below what I would really want. Big feet problems...
