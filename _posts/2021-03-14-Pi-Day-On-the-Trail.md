# Pi Day on The Trail

This is a review of the "Skinners" minimalist shoe / outdoor slipper tested in a desert environment.

## Mica Mountain vs. Skinners

Mica picnic view area is a nice ramada to start your adventure. Tucked away in the desert you're getting into lots of dry sand, thorny cactus needles, rocks and pebbles of all kinds.

I was wearing DarnTough 1/4 hiker socks with these shoes and it was a little cramped. There is a small insert that comes with the Skinners and this was also present. I should have guessed that the fit was going to be tight though -  I had to get the largest size they offered, and that was a size below what I would really want. Big feet problems. I'll probably wear them sans-insert next trek.

You feel guilty wearing these "slippers" on the trail because they are so comfortable. They allow for lots of stretch in any direction and so flex with your movement. The texture of the sole is grippy and substantial enough to prevent any small thorns / needles from poking in. They feel warm with the rubberized coating acting as a good insulator. The mesh uppers do ventilate but in 80 F. sunny weather, they are noticeably warm. I didn't have to dig out many pebbles; might have stopped once, can't recall; was having too much fun being distracted by the desert landscape of saguaros.

I can imagine these shoes would be great for water sports of all kinds, but they are durable and comfortable enough for just about anywhere. Improvements could be made to customizing the fit. I need a larger size at least. And even a simple tongue and lacing system could allow for more versatility.

The shoes remind me of the work gloves that they dip in latex for better grip and protection.

I hope Skinners continues to explore and innovate in the footwear retail space. They are fun to wear, comfortable, and do protect your feet.
