# Hi There! This is a heading lvl one

This is your homepage or index. Fill it with valueless content and portals to invaluable resources. We're using Comfortaa and Oxygen Mono for the fonts, redundancies would be sans-serif and monospace. We just need a nice handwritten font.

## And a heading lvl two

Just testing some things. Testing, texting, one two three. More filler text here, and some more. This is a paragraph that resides in main content area. Main content as in a page's purpose is fulfilled via the content in this main section.

### Heading of the third kind

A new paragraph can be short; like a few phrases.

Others can be just slightly a little longer, but barely.

#### A 4th kind of heading

The most important thing about filler text, is that you allow for paragraphs/sentences (content) of different length, style, and format. Let's test some line spacing with a few more lines. It's crucial to get the right mix between line-height between lines inside a paragraph and spacing between separate paragraphs. Font size of main content areas should be easily readable with good contrast between letter-color and background-color.

##### Almost the last heading

Headings one through six decrease in descending order, while headings four through six remain similar sizes for future styling.

I picked a monospace font for the headings. It only comes in one weight, 400, minimal.

###### The final heading of all time

Well, we got here. Enough content to test all the headings at least. It's been a rough ride at times, but we got you here in one piece good buddy. How about a link?
